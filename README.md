## Error Codes
When coding the drone, you may see the letter 'G' or 'M' appear on the screen. These are errors.

'M' refers to an error with the Motor Controller.
'G' refers to an error with the Gyro.

These errors will be triggered if the Micro:Bit fails to communicate with the Air:Bit V2 Flight Controller.
